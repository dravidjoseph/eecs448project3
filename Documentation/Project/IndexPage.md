#Front Page

This is what the user will see first.

##Head

Contain scripts to format the page correctly.  Basic search functionality for the search button (primarily for demonstration purposes, will be replaced by its own page).

Allows user to input text (right now, just two keywords, but later more generic keywords for searching purposes).  Uses regexes to remove white spaces and will eventually match to GuideBox API specs.

##Navbar

Displays top-level content.  Name of the site, a way to navigate home, and eventually a user login

##Main div

Allows user to input the movie they want to watch.
