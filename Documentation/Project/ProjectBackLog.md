#Product Backlog

This document details the product backlog over the course of this project-what needs to be done in order of priority, as well as features that may come online as needed.  We will use the following metric to estimate the time it takes: 1 point = 1/2 day.  

##Front-end Interface Setup

This is the HTML page that the user will initially interact with.  On a basic level, the user will be allowed to enter a string of text into the form.  Initially will include some advanced search functionality (Name, Date, etc.) for faster processing.  

COMPLETION: 0.5 

##Back-end Display Result Interface Setup

This PHP page will display the results of the user search by sending the results of the HTML form into a POST array.  We can then process the search data as needed to find matches.  This step hopefully will be done in a couple days.

COMPLETION: 4

##Guidebox Practice Queries

In order to get familiar with the Guidebox API, we will need to use the temp key to come up with some practice test pages.  This will hopefully take a day or so.  Everything above will hopefully be done by the Project 3.

COMPLETION: 3

##Link Guidebox API to Backend

Ensure that once the production key is obtained the API is connected to the backend.  This will take the most time out of all of tasks for Project 4, a week or more.

COMPLETION: 10
##User login

Allow the user to set up an account with us, which we can either store or use Facebook/Google authentication.  3 days or so, but this will allow us to add a lot of features

COMPLETION: 10

##Front-end Cleanup

Now that the API is linked properly, clean up front-end in a way that is friendly to the user.

COMPLETION: 5

##Back-end Cleanup

Research techniques to ensure the back-end is functioning effectively

COMPLETION: 10


##Dynamic Search

Allow user to input a regular text string and have that string converted in a form the backend can recognize and search for.  This will most likely need a Search API, in which case it should take about 5 days to set up.  Otherwise it'll take a while.

COMPLETION: 10


##International Search (only if time)

Check availability in different regions for content. Again, will require a search API, and will take 4ish days.

NOTE: GUIDEBOX DOES NOT PROVIDE AVAILABILITY FOR INTERNATIONAL SEARCH PUBLICLY.  WE CONTACTED THEM ABOUT THEIR BETA INTERNATIONAL SEARCH RELEASE AND DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE.
