#Project 3 Sprint


##Front-end Interface Setup

This is the HTML page that the user will initially interact with.  On a basic level, the user will be allowed to enter a string of text into the form.  Initially will include some advanced search functionality (Name, Date, etc.) for faster processing.  This first step should be completed in about a half day.

##Back-end Display Result Interface Setup

This PHP page will display the results of the user search by sending the results of the HTML form into a POST array.  We can then process the search data as needed to find matches.  This step hopefully will be done in a couple days.

##Register Guidebox API key

The GuideBox API will contain most of the information needed for the product to work.  The production key needs to be registered, a process which will take several days.  In the meantime, we will be doing work with a temporary key to gain familiarity with the GuideBox databases.

## Gain familiarity with Guidebox API

Due to the wait needed to obtain a production key (the temp key has severe limitations), there will be some overlap in getting familiar with the Guidebox API from this sprint to the next.  Getting familiar with Guidebox will be crucial to making the project work without incurring significant resource costs.
